# VESPA
**VESPA** is a Computer Vision Python module for training and testing
models with ease. It provides a flexible framework for working with
vision tasks and integrates seamlessly with popular deep learning
libraries such as PyTorch.

## Installation

### CUDA Setup
To enable GPU acceleration with CUDA, follow these steps
to set up the CUDA Toolkit:

1. Download the CUDA Toolkit version 12.1 or higher
from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
2. Run the executable and follow the installation instructions.

### Poetry Installation
For managing dependencies and virtual environments,
**VESPA** uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
To install Poetry, follow the instructions on the official documentation.

### Installing Dependencies
To install all dependencies required for the project,
run the following command:

```bash
poetry install

```

## Activate the Environment

To activate the Poetry environment, use:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Check CUDA Availability

Once the environment is activated, verify if CUDA
is available by running the following command:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

If the output is True, CUDA is successfully
enabled and available for use.

## Getting Started

Once everything is set up, you can start training or testing your models.
VESPA supports various deep learning models for different computer vision
tasks, and can be customized based on your needs.

### Example Usage

```bash
from vespa import Model

# Initialize model
model = Model.load('model.pth')

# Perform inference
result = model.predict(image_path)
print(result)
```

## Models

### Available Models

VESPA provides several state-of-the-art models for
computer vision tasks:

- **RCNN**: A robust model for object detection with regional proposals.
- **RetinaNet**: An efficient one-stage detector with a focal
loss to address class imbalance.
- **YOLO**: Real-time object detection model with high accuracy.

Each model comes pre-trained on popular datasets,
and they can be fine-tuned on your custom dataset.

### Model Specifications

| Model     | Task            | Architecture     | Pretrained Dataset   |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| RCNN      | Object Detection| Region-based CNN | COCO, Pascal VOC     |
| RetinaNet | Object Detection| Focal Loss CNN   | COCO                 |
| YOLO      | Object Detection| Darknet-based    | YOLO                 |

## Metrics

The following evaluation metrics are
supported for model performance evaluation:

- **mAP (mean Average Precision)**: Commonly used to evaluate
object detection models.
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**: Measures the overlap
between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.
- **Precision**: The ratio of correct positive predictions
over all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ratio of correct positive predictions
over all actual positives.
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correct predictions over the
total number of predictions.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall,
providing a balance between the two.

### Model Evaluation Example

To evaluate a model on a dataset:

```bash
from vespa import evaluate

# Evaluate model
results = evaluate(model, test_data_loader)

# Print evaluation metrics
print("mAP:", results['mAP'])
print("IoU:", results['IoU'])
```

## Datasets

**VESPA** supports the following popular datasets
for training and testing:

- **COCO**: A large-scale dataset for object detection,
segmentation, and captioning.
- **Pascal VOC**: A popular dataset for object
detection and segmentation.
- **Custom Datasets**: You can easily integrate your custom
dataset by following the dataset configuration guide.

To load a dataset:

```bash
from vespa import Dataset

# Load COCO dataset
dataset = Dataset.load('coco')

# Load custom dataset
custom_dataset = Dataset.load('custom_dataset')
```

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- **CPU**: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
- **RAM**: 8GB
- **GPU**: CUDA-capable device for faster training
(NVIDIA GTX 1050 or higher recommended)

### Recommended Setup for Training Large Models

- **CPU**: Intel Core i7 or equivalent
- **RAM**: 16GB or more
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 2080 or higher with CUDA support (for faster processing and training)

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8 or higher
- CUDA 12.1 or higher (for GPU support)

## Reporting and Benchmark

To assist users in benchmarking their models, VESPA provides
scripts to evaluate the performance of models across multiple metrics,
allowing for comparison between different architectures and configurations.

### Example Benchmark Script

```bash
python -m vespa.benchmark --model retina_net --dataset coco --batch_size 16
```

This script will benchmark the RetinaNet
model on the COCO dataset with a batch size of 16, and output the results.
