Create a new branch for your changes.
It’s good practice to name your branch something descriptive,
such as `fix-bug`, `add-feature`, or `improve-docs`.

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

Work on your changes locally. Depending on the type of contribution,
you may need to modify code, add tests, or update documentation.

- Ensure that your changes are clear and provide helpful information for users.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once you’ve made your changes, commit them to your branch with
a descriptive commit message.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of the changes made"
```

### 6. Push Your Changes

Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin my-new-branch

### 7. Create a Pull Request

After pushing your changes, open a pull request (PR) against the `main`
branch of the **VESPA** repository. Provide a detailed description of
what you’ve done and why it should be merged.

the main branch. Congratulations, you’ve contributed to VESPA!
